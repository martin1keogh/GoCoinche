# GoCoinche

Toy project about implementing coinche (French card game) in Go.


### NAQ
#### Why?
I wanted to play around a bit with Go.

#### Why coinche yet again?
I'm a boring person and can't think of any cool idea, apparently.

#### The name is terrible.

  1. Not a question.
  2. Don't care.
  3. No, Goinche is actually way worse.
